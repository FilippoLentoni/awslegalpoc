Testing the pipeline

1 modify the UI - push to beta - wait for my approval to propagate to prod. give me the beta and prod website so I can confrim they look different before I push to prod

2 modify the prompt of the agent - same as case 1, I will chat through the beta and prod UI and my expectation is to receive different answers before I push to prod 

3. clean the tech stack from beta and prod adn try to redeploy end to end beta and prod to confirm everything is working fine
